This code was created during the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).
Everything was created in the sense of an exercise for the first semester of my computer science studies, so sometimes it is not really useful or effective implementations, rather the opposite.

I know I'm a little late to the party, but I just found it the other day, and now it makes really much fun.
Wakatime is also not entirely accurate. There are about 5 hours missing in which I have not yet used Wakatime.

So this is just documentation of my process on GitHub.
