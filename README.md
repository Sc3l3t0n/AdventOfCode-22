# AdventOfCode-22

This code was created during the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).
Everything was created in the sense of an exercise for my first semester of my computer science studies, so sometimes it is not really useful or effective implementations, rather the opposite.

So this is just a documentation of my process on Github.
